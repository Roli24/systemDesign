FaceBook Capacity Estimation

1. Character -> 2 bytes
2. Long- > 8 bytes
3. Average Image size -> 300 KB


1 Million -> 6 zeros
1 Billion  -> 9 zeroes


1. No of servers
2. RAM
3. Storage Capacity

Which are important resources for system design

TradeOff [CAP theorem]


X million User * Y MB -> Storage calculation
X * 10^6 * Y * 10 ^6
XY TB


5 Million user * 2 KB => 10^6 * 10 ^3
	10^GB


Estimation of FaceBook : 


Always first Traffic Estimation:

Total User : 1 Billion -> 10 ^9
 DAU :  25 % of total Users
    250 Million User

Any system have read operation/write

Traffic Estimation

5 read
2 write

Almost 7 Query

(250 Million * 7query)/60 *60 *24~86400 ~10000

250 * 10^6 *7/10^5â€¨
2500*7 = 18 K query/second


Storage Assumption:

1 Every user is doing 2 post [250 ]
10% of user is uploading images

1 post -> 250 character
250 * 2 -> 500 Bytes


2 post -> 500* 2 => 1000 Bytes => 1KB

250 * 10^6 * 10^3 => 250 GB/day [Text]
250 * 300 KB (Image size) => 7500 GB = 7 *10^9 => 8TB [Image for Post]

5 years ~ 2000 days
2000* 250 GB [POST] - > 500 TB
2000 * 8 TB [Image] -> 16 PB

RAM Estimation: [Memory Estimation]

For each user last 5 posts cache:
2500 bytes -> 3000 bytes -> 3 KB
250 Million * 3 KB ~

750 GB
 1 machine can have 75 GB

If one machine 75 GB of data in memory
10 machines for caching


Latency: 

500 MS 95%
18 K/ second -> 
1 machine/ server -> 50 threads
1 second -> 500 ms 
1 server -> 50 threads -> 100 requests/second
180 server -> 18k requests/second


CAP Theorem:

Consistency
Availability
Partition Tolerance

At a time only u can achieve two

CA, CP or AP either one of u can have
It should be highly available

AP I will go, consistency can be dropped
